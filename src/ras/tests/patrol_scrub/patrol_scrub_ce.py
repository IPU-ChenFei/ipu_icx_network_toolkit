    Patrol Scrub

    Patrol scrubbing is accomplished using an engine that generates requests to memory addresses in a stride.

    Patrol scrubs are intended to ensure that data with a correctable error does not remain in DRAM long enough to stand a significant chance of further corruption to an uncorrectable error due to high energy particle error.

    This test case injects Memory Corrected Error then Verifies detection using Patrol Scrub.

    Test cas flow:

    -Check if sockets are detected
    -Inject Memory Corrected Error and Verifying detection using Patrol Scrub
    -Obtain OS error logs for the test
