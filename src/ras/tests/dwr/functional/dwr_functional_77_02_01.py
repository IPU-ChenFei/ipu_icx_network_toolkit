    When DWR feature is enabled, Lewisburg can demote Host Partition Reset Timeout (HPR TO) events into a demoted
    warm reset i.e., warm reset without the negotiation. System is not guaranteed to reliably boot after the demoted
    warm reset, but the expectation is that it will load UEFI-FW in most instances. UEFI-FW is expected to boot in
    safe mode following a demoted warm reset. UEFI-FW reads a Lewisburg status register to determine if the last
    reset was a Demoted Warm Reset. When booting after demoted warm reset, the UEFI-FW is expected to perform minimal
    initialization steps, read error logs, deposit error logs to non-volatile memory and issue a global reset. UEFI-FW
    should not attempt to boot an OS in this mode. The sole purpose of the demoted warm reset is to increase the odds
    that the OEM firmware will be able to collect error logs in fatal error conditions.
